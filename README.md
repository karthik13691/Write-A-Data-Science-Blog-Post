### File descriptions

data.zip file containing 
* Calendar.csv (data file about booking information in Seattle). Data source — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data
* Listings.csv (data file about Information about the houses in Seattle). Data source — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

### Results
Based on my analysis it is found that, 

The average price is at peak during JULY and is usually high between MAY and SEPTEMBER.

The average price for an entire home/apartment is $155 per day/night
The average price for a private room is $75 per day/night
shared room costs around $47 per day/night

Apartments/Houses comprise of about 2/3 of total listings
30% of the listings are Private rooms

Neighborhoods of Downtown, Magnolia, Inter bay and Capitol Hills are expensive and their average price is between $150 — $200 range.
Rooms with cheaper rates are found in areas like Beacon Hill, Delridge, Rainier Valley, and Northgate with pricing around the $83 — $93 range.

The key feature that impacts price more than other features is the Accommodates, which is the number of people the apartment can accomodate.
