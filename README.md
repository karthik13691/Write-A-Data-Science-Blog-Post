### Results
Based on my analysis it is found that, 

The peak season is from June to August and are lowest is from January to March
The rates are higher on weekends
Apartments and Houses comprise of about 90% of total listings
Neighborhoods of Southeast Magnolia, Portage Bay and Westlake have highest mean price, while the neighborhoods of Rainier Beach, Olympic Hills and South Delridge have lowest mean prices
Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford have highest listing counts, while neighborhoods of Roxhill, South Park and Pinehurst have lower listing counts
Accommodation size (determined by number of bedrooms, how many people it accommodates, number of bathrooms) is by far the single biggest price influencer.
